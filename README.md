# ttravel

Clone this git. I have written the instructions without checking if it works. Just try it and if you face any issues, ping me. I will follow up asap. <br>
Open command prompt or terminal <br>
If any command doesnt work, try to start the command with sudo. Like 'sudo pip install xyz'. Also have python 2.7 installed in your pc. <br>
1. install pip on windows/mac/ubuntu (google it)<br>
2. go to the location where you want to save the project and then type command, git clone<br> https://github.com/flynsequeira/ttravel.git<br>
3. cd ttravel<br>
3. pip install virtualenv<br>
4. virtualenv venv<br>
5. source venv/bin/activate<br>
6. Now you are inside virtual environment<br>
7. pip install Flask<br>
8. pip install requirements<br>
  if this doesnt work, try 'pip install requirements.txt'<br>
9. python app.py<br>
  This command should start the server and also show the url. It usually shows 0.0.0.0/8000. If it doesn't there's an issue. Ping me. Open that url in your pc and happy coding. If you face any<br> issue, ping me, and I'll check it out.<br>
