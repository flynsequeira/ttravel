# ttravel

Clone this git. I have written the instructions without checking if it works. Just try it and if you face any issues, ping me. I will follow up asap. 
Open command prompt or terminal
If any command doesnt work, try to start the command with sudo. Like 'sudo pip install xyz'. Also have python 2.7 installed in your pc.
1. install pip on windows/mac/ubuntu (google it)
2. go to the location where you want to save the project and then type command, git clone https://github.com/flynsequeira/ttravel.git
3. cd ttravel
3. pip install virtualenv
4. virtualenv venv
5. source venv/bin/activate
6. Now you are inside virtual environment
7. pip install Flask
8. pip install requirements
  if this doesnt work, try 'pip install requirements.txt'
9. python app.py
  This command should start the server and also show the url. Open that url in your pc and happy coding. If you face any issue, ping me, and I'll check it out.
